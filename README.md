# Iris_Classification

**Attempting to discern between 3 classes of iris.**

Here the data from the iconic Fisher's Iris Data is imported and plotted using tools from Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Next, the data is split into a training set and validation set. The data set aside for validation is not used for training, evaluating, or selecting models. 
==This ensures that the data used for validating our model yields a fair and credible result.==
